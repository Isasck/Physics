Chapter 6 -- Wave Nature of Light and Electromagnetic Waves

1. Consider Young's double slit experiment. 
   a) What are the features of intereference pattern produced?

   b) Why can't it be done by replacing the double slit with two light sources?
    Ans: Light waves from two light sources are not coherent and the interference pattern is not observable.

   ci) How can an interference pattern be produced?
    Ans: The slit width must be COMPARABLE to the wavelength. The two slits cannot be too far apart. (e.g. slit width of 0.1mm is acceptable, but not 1mm)

   cii**) Alternative minima and maxima can be detected along the screen only if the slits are very narrow. Explain briefly. [2 marks]
    Ans: Only narrow slits allow light waves to diffract enough [1] so that the diffracted waves can overlap. [1]

   d) Under what conditions can the pattern be observed?
    Ans: When the light waves passing through the two slits are coherent and have similar amplitudes.

   e) What changes are there in the pattern if the monochromatic light source is replaced by white light? [3 marks]
    Ans: The central bright fringe is white. [1]
         For other orders of maxima, colour spectra are formed. [1]
         For each spectrum, the inner edge is violet while the outer edge is red. [1]

   f) Recall the relevant formulas.

   g****) Someone claims that more fringes can be captured on the screen if the screen is moved towards the double slit. Explain whether this claim is correct. [2 marks]
    Ans: Correct: Bright fringes of larger angular separations from the central bright fringe can be projected on the screen if the screen is closer to the double slit.
         Incorrect: The pattern formed by a double slit is very narrow. Moving the screen towards the slit will not increase the number of fringes captured.

   h) Explain the changes of fringe pattern when the setup is put in water. [3 marks]
    Ans: Light travels slower in water. By v = fλ, the wavelength of light in water is shorter than that in air. Therefore, fringes formed on the screen will be more closely spaced.
   
   i) Explain how the pattern is formed. [3 marks]
    Ans: -The light waves diffract when they pass through the two slits
         -Diffracted waves from the two slits interfere and form the pattern
         -The points of constructive interference correspond to bright fringes, while the points of desturctive interference correspond to dark fringes.
          
2. What factors affect the interference pattern for a) double slit b) diffraction grating?

3. When calculating the wavelength using the double slit formula, what assumption is made? (small angle approximation)

4. Consider an experiment where a monochromatic light source is directed at a diffraction grating along a metre rule.
   a) What are the features of intereference pattern produced?

   b) Under what condition can the angle of diffraction be calculated accurately? / How can we improve the accuracy of the experiment?
    Ans: When the grating-screen distance is much larger than the grating spacing. / Move the screen further away from the grating to increase the grating-screen distance.

   c) Given grating spacing and wavelength, find the maximum total number of bright fringes formed.

   d) State two applications of interference in daily-life. (Gauze curtain, colourful butterfly wings, DVD)

   e) The illuminated slit may not be well aligned along the metre rule. Suggest one way to reduce this error. (from DSE 2014 paper 1B q7) [2 marks]
    Ans: Repeat the procedures with the pin on the other side of the observer. [1] Take the average value of y obtained from both sides to calculate λ.

5. Describe two ways to estimate the wavelength of a laser light with i) double slit ii) diffraction grating. 
   iii) Suggest and explain one precaution that can make the results more accurate. iv) Compare the accuracy of two methods. [12 marks]

   i) -Direct the laser beam perpendicularly to the double slit to project an interference pattern on the screen
      -Measure the distance D between the double slit and the screen
      -Measure the distance y between the zeroth-order and the nth-order bright fringes
      -Calculate the wavelength of laser light λ by Δy = y/n and Δy = λD/a

   ii) -Direct the laser beam perpendicularly to the grating to project an interference pattern on the screen
       -Measure the distance D between the grating and the screen
       -Measure the distance y between the zeroth-order and the nth-order bright fringes
       -Calculate the angle of diffraction x by tan(x) = y/D, then calculate the wavelength of light λ by dsinx = nλ

   iii) Using higher-order bright fringe rather than the first-order bright fringe when measuring y. This reduces the percentage error in y.

   iv) Diffraction grating, because the interference pattern formed by it is larger than that of double slit, resulting in a more accurate measurement of fringe separation.

6. Compare double slit and grating regarding the following aspects and explain briefly.
   a) Brightness of pattern: grating allows more light to pass through than a double slit, fringes are brighter
   b) Span of pattern: Slit separation is much smaller than grating spacing. By comparing the two formulas, the value of θ is much larger for a grating
   c) Angle of diffraction √ for nth-order bright fringe
   d) Fringe separation: evenly spaced vs larger fringes further from centre
   e) Distance between nth-order and 0th-order bright fringes
   f) Highest order of bright fringe

7a. Why are radio waves more commonly used in telecommunications than microwaves even though microwaves can carry more information?

Ans: Radio waves have a longer wavelength and can diffract more around objects for signal transmission.

7b. Why are microwaves used in satellite telecommunications but not radio waves?

Ans: Radio waves have lower frequency and hence greater diffraction effect. They by-pass small obstacles and are not to be reflected from them.

8. State the a) properties and b) applications of EM waves.

9. State the mathematical relationship between wave speed, wave length, sinθ and refractive index for a fixed frequency.

10. Explain why the reception of signals is affected when a large cargo ship passes near the source of signal transmission.

Ans: The radio waves reflected by the cargo ship interfere with the waves coming directly from the source, so reception is affected.

11. Refer to DSE practice on p.136. 
   a) As the receivers moves from P to Q, the loudspeaker produces loud and soft sounds alternately. Explain briefly.
    Ans: -The path difference of the diffracted waves from X and Y to the receiver varies along PQ
         -Minima are recorded where destructive interference occurs, so soft sounds are produced. Miaxma are recorded where constructive interference occurs, so loud sounds are produced

   b) What is the restriction on the widths of the slits in this experiment?
    Ans: They should be COMPARABLE to the wavelength of the microwaves.

   c) Someone expects the loudspeaker to produce a loud sound when the receiver is at P. However it does not. Explain briefly why this problem exists and suggest a method to fix it.
    Ans: -The DISTANCE OF THE TRANSMITTERS FROM X and Y are different, so the MICROWAVES COMING OUT from the two slits may not be IN PHASE. 
         -The problem can be fixed by locating the transmitter at EQUAL DISTANCE FROM X and Y

12***) Consider a transmitter emitting microwaves towards a convex paraffin lens. The loudspeaker will produce a louder sounds if the pointer detector detects a stronger microwave signal.
       Explain why the loudest sound is produced at a particular position.

    Ans: The microwaves are converged by the convex paraffin lens. (superposition)

13. Determine if X is double slit or a grating based on a picture of the interference pattern. (tip: answer according to the comparable + observable features in q6, e.g. span)

Example Ans: Grating. SPAN OF PATTERN produced by a double slit would be much narrower.

14. State some precautions taken in double slit/grating experiment to produce an observable pattern.

15. DSE 2015 paper 1B q5
    b: State and explain your observation when two small LEDs with same wavelength separated by 6mm are directed onto a screen.
     Ans: The screen is uniformly illuminated. [1] The light from the LEDs is incoherent. [1]

    dii: Why does the value obtained by calculation differ with the measurement in circular water waves?
     Ans: Screen has to be far away from slits (D >> a). [1] Small angle approximation cannot be applied. [1]

Ans: -Slit separation should be very small
     -Laboratory should be blacked out
     -Slits shd be as narrow as possible
     -Screen should be placed at a suitable distance of around 1-2m
     -If a filament lamp is used as the light source, make sure that the filament is parallel to the slits

Other tips/misconceptions/common mistakes:
1. Only diffraction and interference serve as evidence for the wave nature of light.
2. Recite the EM spectrum briefly.
3. How to find maximum number of bright fringes observed in double slit experiment, given a) wavelength, b) slit separation, c) sinθ
   (Original question: p.146 q29) (If observations can be carried out up to an angle of 2° on both sides of the central maximum)
   --> remember a sinθ => nλ
