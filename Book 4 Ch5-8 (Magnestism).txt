Chapter 5 -- Magnetic Fields

1. Describe a method to find the magnetic pattern on the cardboard using iron fillings.

Ans: -Sprinkle some iron fillings on the cardboard
     -Tap the cardboard gently
     -The magnetic field pattern is reflected by the pattern of the iron fillings

2a) Describe the procedure for an experiment to investigate the relationship between strength of an electromagnet and the no. of turns of its coil.

Ans: -Use the electromagnet to attract the iron clips
     -Record the number of iron clips when the chain just falls downward
     -Change the nubmer of turns of the coil and repeat the above procedure
     -Record the change of the number of iron clips when the chain just falls downward
     -In each trial, the current should be kept constant

2b) Describe the procedure for an experiment to investigate the relationship between the strength of magnetic field inside a long solenoid 
    and the no. of turns per unit length of the solenoid. State your expected reuslts.

Ans: -Connect the rheostat, ammeter and the slinky spring in series to a power supply
     -Stretch the ~ to a certain length. Measure the length l by the meter rule and calculate the no. of turns per unit length n
     -Measure the magnetic field B at the centre of the slinky spring using the magnetic field sensor
     -Repeat the experimenti by stretching the slinky spring to different lengths. The resistance of the rheostat should be adjusted in every trial so that 
      the I through the circuit is set to the same value
     -Plot the B-n graph. The graph should be a straight line passing through origin.

3. Describe the experiment to illustrate the fact that the magnetic field between two slab-shaped magnets with unlike poles facing each other is uniform

Ans: -Place the cardboard on top of the magnets ~
     -~ + ~
     -The iron fillings will form evenly spaced parallel lines between the magnets

4. Estimate the typical strengths of magnetic fields (e.g. Earth magnetic flux density, small bar magnet)

5. Explain if the strength of the magnetic field will be affected by a change in the cross sectional area of the solenoid.

6. Book p.210 q6b): How can the apparatus be modified so that it can also measure the direction of the current?

Ans: Replace the soft-iron block by a permanent magnet with one of the poles facing the coil. 
     By doing so, the coils is attracted towards the magnet when I flows in one direction and is repelled by it when I flows in the other direction.

7. Suggest 3 ways to strengthen electromagnets.

8. State one assumption used when calculating the magnetic field strength using the forumla B = u0I/2πr

Ans: The length of the coil is much larger than its radius (l >> r).

9. Book p.217 q17a: The electromagnet in this design is inefficient in attracting magnetic materials. Explain why and suggest an improvement.

Ans: -The poles of the electromagnet which produce the greatest attractive force are not facing the materials to be sorted
     -Turn the electromagnet by 90° so that one end of the coil faces the materials to be sorted / Use a U-shaped core (with both ends facing the ~)

10. An electromagnet with a steel core retains its magnetism even after the switch is opened. Why? Suggest a solution to this problem.

Ans: -Steel retains part of its magnetic property after the external magnetic field is removed
     -This can be solved by replacing the steel core with a soft iron core

11. Book p.217 q19: Briefly explain how a 'ding-dong' sound is heard when the bell-push is pressed and released.

Ans: -When ~, a I flows through the coil. The coil produces a B which attracts the soft iron rod.
     -The soft iron rod is pulled into the coil and tip Q hits metal plate A. This produces the 'ding' sound.
     -When ~ is released, no I flows through the coil and the soft-iron rod is no longer attracted. 
      The spring pushes the soft iron rod out of the coil and tip P hits metal plate B. This produces the 'dong' sound.

12. How do maglev trains float? Why is a maglev train ride smoother and faster? (HKDSE 2020 1B q3)

Ans: -Repulsive force between like poles allows ~
     -As the train is not in contact with the rail, there is no friction between train and rail 
      -> less vibration (smooother)
      -> propulsion of train only needs to work against AR (faster)
